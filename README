ZSH, VIM and other configuration files, user specific configuration files,
utilities functions and theme for my personal use.

Each .zshrc-{username} contains specific user information.

Assuming you put the config to /Users/YOURPROFILE/ and you name your repo '.config', you should just
create the following symlinks (or copy the files):
cd ~
ln -s .config/.zshrc-trasher .zshrc-`whoami`
ln -s .config/.zshrc .
ln -s .config/.zsh_functions .
ln -s .config/.zsh-ulysses-theme .

In order to use the root config, just use .zshrc-root instead of .zshrc-trasher,
and omit .zsh-ulysses-theme.

To use vim config files, you'll have to create the following symlinks
(or copy the files):
ln -s .config/.vim .
ln -s .config/.vimrc .
ln -s .config/.vimrc.local .
ln -s .config/.vimrc.plugins .
ln -s .config/.vimrc.plugins.local .

Other config files may be linked as well, depending on requirements

If you want persistent undo, you can create a dedicated directory for undo
history files:
mkdir ~/.vim/undodir 

You can change the directory location and name but don't forget to change it
also in .vimrc file (just change the 'undodir' variable value).
